# Transcriptome Assembly Workshop, Spring 2019
National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS) SPRING WORKSHOP 2019 Schedule\
April 29th to May1st, 2019 \
Bloomington, IN 

# Description 
The workshop includes discussions, lectures, and hands-on tutorials to cover topics important to getting started on constructing and analyzing transcriptomes—without the use of a genome. Material will cover both the availability and use of high performance computing (HPC) resources, alongside the task of assembling a new transcriptome, in order to provide a more comprehensive preparation for this and future bioinformatic tasks.

Transcriptome assembly will consist of using four separate assemblers (Trinity, SOAP de novo, Velvet Oases, and TransABySS), with multiple kmers, to be combined and curated with Evigenes. This combined assembly with multiple parameters is considered much more robust than simply using one assembler, and the NCGAS pipeline streamlines the process and allows for customization if desired. The final transcripts from Evigenes, can then be processed for downstream handling of differential expression (through Trinity wrappers) and annotation (Trinotate).  

**Updates from last workshop** - This workshop we have also included of quality control scripts (through Quast and BUSCO) to assess the quality of the transcrips assembled, and a demo on visualizing KEGG pathways. 

While material will make heavy use of IU machines, the material is transferable to any cluster.
